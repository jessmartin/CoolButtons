CoolButtons
================================

CoolButtons is a subclass of UIButton that draws glassy iOS style
buttons, all using CoreGraphics and no images.

Usage
================================

Add the QuartzCore.framework to your project:

    # It should be around here somewhere
    /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS4.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/QuartzCore.framework

Add the CoolButton.m/.h to your project, create an instance of a
CoolButton, then set the buttonColor like so.

    [myCoolButton setButtonColor:[UIColor blueColor]];

CoolButton takes care of the rest and draws appropriately shaded drop
shadows, gradient, inner shadow, and borders.

Todo
================================

* Fix the border to be an inner glow for more accuracy to the Apple
  buttons
* Add additional button customization to turn on/off the various design
  elements
